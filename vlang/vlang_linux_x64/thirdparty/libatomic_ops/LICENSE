Our intent is to make it easy to use libatomic_ops, in both free and
proprietary software.  Hence most of code (core library) that we expect to
be linked into a client application is covered by a MIT or MIT-style license.

However, a few library routines (the gpl extension library) are covered by
the GNU General Public License.  These are put into a separate library,
libatomic_ops_gpl.a file.

Most of the test code is covered by the GNU General Public License too.


The low-level (core) part of the library (libatomic_ops.a) is mostly covered
by the MIT license:

Some files in the atomic_ops/sysdeps directory (part of core library) were
inherited in part from the Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative garbage collector,
and are covered by its license, which is similar in spirit to MIT license:

----------------------------------


A few files are covered by the GNU General Public License.  (See file
"COPYING".)  This applies only to the test code and the atomic_ops_gpl
portion of the library.  Thus, atomic_ops_gpl should generally not be
linked into proprietary code.  (This distinction was motivated by patent
considerations.)
