The libgc source is distributed here as an amalgamation (https://sqlite.org/amalgamation.html).
This means that, rather than mirroring the entire bdwgc repo here,
[this script](https://gist.github.com/spaceface777/34d25420f2dc4953fb7864f44a211105) was used
to bundle all local includes together into a single C file, which is much easier to handle.
Furthermore, the script above was also used to minify (i.e. remove comments and whitespace in)
the garbage collector source. Together, these details help keep the V source distribution small,
can reduce compile times by 3%-15%, and can help C compilers generate more optimized code.
