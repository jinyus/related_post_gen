## V 0.3.5
*29 June 2023*

#### Improvements in the language
- **Coroutines with a scheduler**. Only Linux/macOS for now, requires `-use-coroutines` and
  `coroutines.sleep()` instead of `time.sleep()`. They work with IO and net, but not with GC
  for now.
- `spawn` now spawns system threads, `go` spawns coroutines.
- Static type methods: `Foo.new()` to replace factory functions like `new_foo()`.
- Smartcasting with complex conditions:`if sum_type is Foo && !sum_type.is_info && get_name(sum_type.info.name) == 'foo' `.
- Functions can now return fixed size arrays.
- Enum values now can have attributes.
- Generic functions as function parameters are now supported: `fn f[T](x T, i int, f_ Fn[T]) T { `.
- Anonymous structs can no longer have attributes.

#### Breaking changes
- `byte` deprecated in favor of `u8` (`byte` is automatically converted to `u8` by vfmt).

#### Checker improvements/fixes

- time, x.json2: improve iso8601 time decoding.
- builtin: zero out internal map/array pointers on m.free(), to reduce the work for the GC
  mark phase for non escaping maps/arrays, used in hot loops.
- time: add more detailed error descriptions, add custom format parsing with time.parse_format.
- sync: add Mutex.destroy and RwMutex.destroy methods.
- datatypes: add Bloom filter.
- rand: add missing rand.u16(), update doc comments, add test.
- builtin: speed up string methods with vmemcpy instead of `for` loop for copying data.

## V 0.3.4

*30 Apr 2023*

#### Breaking Changes

The following changes may break compilation of existing code or change behavior at runtime:

- `json`: enums are serialized as strings by default, `[json_as_number]` attribute can be used for
  the old behavior.

  If you are serializing enums to JSON in your application, then you will need to add the
  `[json_as_number]` attribute to keep the old behavior!

- Variable shadowing has been completely banned (previously variable names could conflict with
  module names).

#### Web

- vweb now supports live page reloading.
  The web app is instantly updated in the browser (no need to refresh the page)
  every time a **.v** or a **.html** file is changed.
- vweb is now significantly faster and more stable under load, due to a new multithreaded worker
  pool, which is much more efficient at spreading the workload among all threads equally.
- vweb now supports middleware.
- vweb now supports controllers.
  It's now possible to have multiple app structs to better separate logic.
- vweb now supports overridable `.not_found()` method for custom 404 pages in vweb.
- vweb now uses database pool.
- Fixed multipart form parsing in vweb.

#### Backends

- A new pure WASM backend, based on binaryen, a WASM `builtin` module, and a pure V WASM serialization library.
- Lots of fixes and new features in the native backend, including making codegen logic platform independent.
- Now code generated by the Ð¡ backend, can be compiled by a C++20 compiler.
- C backend does not generate unused interface functions now.

#### Compiler CLI

- `v share file.v` for sharing code via the playground.
- `v up` speed up for when it hasn't been run for a long time (**vc/** bootstrapping has been
  optimized).
- `v init` no longer overwrites existing `src/main.v`.
- `v self` now uses a faster TCC backend on macOS (Intel/Apple Silicon), just like on Windows/Linux.
- A new command line flag `-e` for running short V programs on command line: `v -e "println(2+5)"` (
  works just like in Perl).
- A new `-ldflags` option, in addition to `-cflags`. Works just like LDFLAGS in C.

#### ORM

- All ORM queries now return `![]` (`Result` of an array).
  This allows handling/propagating DB errors and simplifies working with ORM (one way).
- Many ORM improvements: type checks for `limit/offset/order by/where`; support of reference objects
  in `insert`; struct fields can be used with `limit/offset`; `Connection` interface.
- ORM now supports the `like` operator:
  ```v
  users := sql db {
      select from User where name like 'Bob%'
  }
  ```
- A new `-d trace_orm` option to see all SQL queries generated and used by V ORM and
  `-d trace_pg_error` to trace PG errors.

#### Standard Library

- Added new `termios` module.
- `net.ssl`: types using ssl contexts can now be converted to strings via `.str()`/printed
  via `println()`.
- `v.reflection`: added type symbol info metadata.
- `crypto` and `math` modules have been updated to use `Result` instead of `Option`.
- `datatypes.LinkedList[map]` now works correctly.
- `urllib.Values.get()` now returns an Option.
- `strconv`: `v_printf()` was made private, `v_sprintf()` was deprecated. String interpolation
  should be used instead.
- `net.http`: mime types have been updated to include all official types.
- `gg`: `create_image()` now returns `!Image` instead of `Image`, allowing to handle errors.
- `sokol`: errors during image creation no longer result in a panic, but can be handled by the
  programmer.
- `sokol`: macOS apps can now be quit using **Cmd+Q**.
- `os.hostname()` and `os.loginname()` now return `Result`.
- `strconv.atoi` optimizations.
- `println()` now supports arrays with recursive references.
- `termux`: support for cross-compilation from termux to other platforms.
- `readline` module now works much better on macOS: key navigation, history, etc (now on par with
  Linux).
- `os`: fixed a memleak in `getline()`.
- `os.Process` now has a `create_no_window` option (Windows only).
- `os.Process` now has a `set_work_folder()` method to set the initial working folder of the new
  child process.

#### Option as a first class type

Final steps in making the Option type a first class type:

- If guards now work with struct fields which are `Option` functions.
  Such fields can now also be assigned to other fields/variables.
- Option receivers can no longer have methods.
- `none` can now be cast to all `Option` types, including aliases.
- Option references are now supported: `?&Type`.
- Arrays of `Option`s are now allowed.
- Allow `foo := Foo{}`, when `Foo` has an Option field, that is a struct, that has a `[required]`
  tag on its fields.

#### Compile-time Reflection

- Compile-time interface fields evaluation.
- Compile-time enum evaluation:
  ```v
  $for item in MyEnum.fields {
      println(item.value)
      println(item.name)
  }
  ```
- Added `$option` as a compile-time reflection type representing an any Option type.
- All special compile-time reflection types are now lowercase (`$int`, `$enum`, `$option`, etc).

#### Checker Improvements/Fixes

- Enums can no longer be initialized like structs.
- Capture variables can no longer shadow anonymous function params.
- Mixing multi-return results with other types in return statements is no longer allowed.
- Assigning anonymous structs to named structs is no longer allowed.
- `[required]` fields are now checked for embedded structs.
- Fixed a bug with closures with fixed array variables.
- Builtin methods `first/last/repeat` can now be used in custom user types (previously they only
  worked in builtin arrays).
- Generic struct initialization no longer needs explicit types to be provided:
  ```v
  struct Foo[T, U] {
  	a T
  	b U
  }

  foo := Foo{
  	a: 2
  	b: 'x'
  }

  println(foo)
  ```
- unsafe: dereferencing nil references is no longer allowed in the following case:
  ```v
  a := unsafe { nil }
  println(*a)
  ```

#### OSes

- Added basic QNX support.

#### Other changes

- Lots of documentation/readme improvements.
- Lots of playground improvements: [play.vlang.io](https://play.vlang.io), including a really cool
  feature: "Show generated C code".
- A new `[spawn_stack: 131072]` function attribute for controlling the max size of the stack of the
  spawned threads.
- Channel pop now works with an `or` block: `ch := <-self.item or { return none }`
- `it` has been renamed to `index` in array inits.
- "Is V still fast?" web-page has been sped up by splitting the result table into multiple years.

#### Development

- GitHub Copilot summaries in PRs.

## V 0.3.3
*30 Jan 2023*
#### Improvements in the language
- String interpolation simplified to just '${name}', enforced by vfmt, and updated in the entire code base.
- `go foo()` has been replaced with `spawn foo()` (launches an OS thread, `go` will be used for
  upcoming coroutines instead).
- vfmt now supports `// vfmt off` and `// vfmt on` for turning off the formatting locally for short snippets of code.
  Useful for keeping your carefully arranged matrices intact.
- Match branch range expressions with consts: `match x { const1...const2 {} }`
- Hot code reloading via `[live]` is now supported in imported modules, not just the main module.
- Syntax sugar for map inits without needing explicit casts for interfaces: `all.children := { "abc": rect, "def": ui.rectangle()}`.
- `$embed_file()` fixes, including variable args support.
- `none` fixes: no longer allowed to be used as a separate type, `dump()` support, not allowed inside `unsafe`.
- Const functions: `const y = term.yellow`, then `println(y('abc'))`.
- Builtin type names can no longer be used as identifiers.
- Generic `typeof[T]()`, `sizeof[T]()`, `isreftype[T]()` functions.
- Deprecated `-error-limit` in favour of the documented `-message-limit` option.

- Recursive aliasing is no longer allowed (e.g. `type Alias = map[string]Alias`).

#### Breaking changes
- `[]` is now used for generics instead of `<>`.
- Accessing a pointer map value requires an `or {}` block outside `unsafe`.

#### Checker improvements/fixes
