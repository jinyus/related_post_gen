PATH can be both files and directories.

The `--verify` flag is useful for use in CI setups for checking if a V project
has all it's functions and methods documented:
```
v missdoc --verify path/to/code
```

The `--diff` flag is useful if your project is not yet fully documented
but you want to ensure that no new functions or methods are introduced
between commits or branches:
```
v missdoc --diff current/code new/code
```
