`v watch` collects all .v files needed for a compilation

Usage:
  v watch [--clear] [--ignore .db] [--add /path/to/a/file.v] [other V options] [run] program.v

`v watch` collects all .v files needed for a compilation, then when
any of the .v source files change, it re-runs the compilation.


Options:
  -s, --silent           Be more silent; do not print the watch timestamp
                         before each re-run.

  -c, --clear            Clears the terminal before each re-run.

  -a, --add <string>     Add more files to be watched (separated by ,).
                         Useful with `v watch -add=feature.v run cmd/v feature.v`,
                         when you want to change *both* the V compiler,
                         and the `feature.v` file.

  -i, --ignore <string>  Ignore files having these extensions (separated by ,)
                         Useful with `v watch -ignore=.db run vwebserver.v`,
                         if your `vwebserver` writes to an sqlite.db file in
                         the same folder.

  -o, --only-watch <string>
                         Watch only files matching these glob patterns
                         The patterns are separated by `,`. Example for
                         a markdown renderer project:
                             v watch --only-watch=*.v,*.md run .

  --before <string>      A command to execute *before* each re-run.
                         Example: --before 'v wipe-cache'

  --after <string>       A command to execute *after* each re-run.
                         Example: --after 'rm -rf /tmp/v/'

You can also customise the timeout, after `v watch` will re-start a monitored
program automatically, even if it was not changed by setting the environment
variable VWATCH_TIMEOUT (in seconds). By default, it is 5 min. (300 seconds).
