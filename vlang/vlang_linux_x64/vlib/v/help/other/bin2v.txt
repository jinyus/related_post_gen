Converts a list of arbitrary files into a single v module file.

Usage:
  v bin2v [options] FILE[...]

You can use this tool to embed binary files, like pictures or fonts inside
the executable of a v program, such that it would not need access to external
resources during runtime, and it would be as self-contained as possible.

Options:
  -h, --help             Show this help screen.
  -m, --module <string>  Name of the generated module.
  -p, --prefix <string>  A prefix put before each resource name.
  -w, --write <string>   Write directly to a file with the given name.
