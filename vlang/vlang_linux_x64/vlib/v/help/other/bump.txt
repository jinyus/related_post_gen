Bump the semantic version of the v.mod and/or specified files.

Usage:
  v bump [options] [file1 file2 ...]

The first instance of a version number is replaced with the new version.
Additionally, the line affected must contain the word "version" in any
form of capitalization. For instance, the following lines will be
recognized by the heuristic:

tool_version = '1.2.1'
version: '0.2.42'
VERSION = "1.23.8"

If certain lines need to be skipped, use the --skip option. For instance,
the following command will skip lines containing "tool-version":

  v bump --patch --skip "tool-version" [files...]

Examples:
  Bump the patch version in v.mod if it exists
    v bump --patch
  Bump the major version in v.mod and vls.v
    v bump --major v.mod vls.v
  Upgrade the minor version in sample.v only
    v bump --minor sample.v


Options:
  -h, --help           Show this help text.
  -m, --major          Bump the major version.
  -n, --minor          Bump the minor version.
  -p, --patch          Bump the patch version.
  -s, --skip <string>  Skip lines matching this substring.
