check-md is a tool to check the passed markdown files for correct ```v ```
code blocks and other style violations like too long lines/links etc...

Usage:
	v check-md [flags] <...files> - Check the given .md files.
	v check-md [flags] <...dirs>  - Check *all* files in the given directories.
	Note: You can also combine files and directories.

Options:
  -silent               Do not show a progress bar.
  -w, -hide-warnings    Do not print warnings, only errors.

NB: There are several special keywords, which you can put after the code fences
for v.
These are:
  compile      Default, can be omitted. The example will be compiled
               and formatting is verified.
  cgen         The example produces C code, which may not be
               compilable (when external libs are not installed).
               Formatting is verified.
  live         Compile hot reload examples with the ´-live´ flag set
               and verify formatting.
  ignore       Ignore the example, useful for examples that just use
               the syntax highlighting
  failcompile  Known failing compilation. Useful for examples
               demonstrating compiler errors.
  okfmt        Should only be formatted, but it can refer to invalid
               modules, missing functions etc. Useful for partial
               examples.
  oksyntax     Should parse, and be formatted, but may not compile.
               Useful for partial examples.
  badsyntax    Known bad syntax, it should NOT even parse.
  wip          Like ignore; a planned feature; easy to search.
  nofmt        Disable fmt verification for individual code blocks.
