Other less frequently used commands supported by V include:

  ast              Generate a json representation of the AST for a given .v file.

  bug              Post an issue on the V's issue tracker, including the failing program,
                   and some diagnostic information.

  bin2v            Convert a binary file to a v source file,
                   that can be later embedded in a module or program.

  build-examples   Test if all examples can be built.

  build-tools      Test if all tools can be built.

  build-vbinaries  Test if V can be built with different configuration.

  check-md         Check that V examples in markdown files are formatted and can compile.

  doctor           Display some useful info about your system to help reporting bugs.

  setup-freetype   Setup thirdparty freetype on Windows.

  share            Send your code to the V Playground

  translate        Translate C code to V.

  tracev           Produce a tracing version of the v compiler.
                   Use `tracev yourfile.v` when the compiler panics.
                   NB: `tracev` is much slower and more verbose than ordinary `v`


  test-all         Run most checks, that the CI does locally.
                   It may take over 2 minutes, and it needs internet connectivity too,
                   because it tries to also verify that `v install` works.

  test-fmt         Test if all files in the current directory are formatted properly.

  test-parser      Test that the V parser works with the given files, as if
                   they were typed by a human programmer, one character at a time.
                   NB: *very slow* for longer files (tens of seconds for 1KB .v file).
                   Mainly useful as a parser bug finder for the V Language Server project.

  test-self        Test if V is working properly by running all tests, including the compiler ones.
                   NB: this can take 1-2 minutes to run.

  wipe-cache       Remove the V cache folder. Useful for cleaning the cache, and guaranteeing a 
                   clean build.
