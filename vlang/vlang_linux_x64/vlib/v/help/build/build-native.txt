This command compiles the given target, along with their dependencies,
into an executable using the Native code generation backend.

Usage:
  v -native [-options] ['run'] <target.v|target_directory> [run options]


For more general build help, see also `v help build`.

# Interfacing the Native code generation, passing options to it:
   -v                         Display the assembly code generated
                              (that may change to `-showasm` in the future)

   -arch <arch>               Select target architecture
                              Only `arm64` and `amd64` are supported

   -os <os>, -target-os <os>  Change the target OS that V compiles for.


The supported targets for the native backend are: `macos`, `linux` and 'windows'
